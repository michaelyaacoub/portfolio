I collaborated with a team of four developers to remodel [Calvary Chapel](https://www.ccoth.com/)'s website. The goal was to rebuild a web app that could be managed by an average person, meaning creating, updating, and deleting event cards that include information about upcoming events, a poster image that is managed and stored by Firebase. As well as embedded videos and live streaming. We were asked to give the church's team access to these features by user login.
